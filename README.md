# Medical-Insurance-cost-prediction (Machine learning using python)
Following steps were followed:
medical insurance Data was collected from kaggle.
Data Analysis was done.
data preprocessing was done for building Machine learning linear regression model.
Model was trained for training data and further applied on Test data for the prediction.
Finally R2 values were obtained by the model for train and test data respectively.
